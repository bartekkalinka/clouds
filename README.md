======
Goal: Find the golden cloud and jump on top of it. 

Hint: Golden cloud emits yellow tiles. 

Controls: Arrows for right, left and jump. 

More info: Big clouds fly slower, small quicker. With player on top, cloud loses energy 
and eventually begins to fall. Big clouds have a lot of energy, small have little.
